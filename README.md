# GeaCommerce
**GeaCommerce is an online web shop application, made with Spring MVC & Thyemeleaf, which main functionality assumes searching for products & eventually buying them.**

1. Users need to create an account in order to buy the wanted product, whereas not-logged users can only view details of the products and write inquiries/call to order the product.

2. The application has one admin, who can add new products, update them, delete them, and track the orders & inquiries that he needs to fulfill.
